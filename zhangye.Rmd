### SANTA MONICA, MEXICO, THE SCHOOL BOARD AND TEACHING KIDS MATHEMATICS
**Olshen**: That’s just fine. Now, somehow all of this or a lot of it seems to have taken place in Santa Monica. I’m curious about your other involvements in Santa Monica, for example, with the Santa Monica School Board, how you came to be not only on it, but also its leader.

**Olshen**: 很好。现在看来，这些工作全部或者说很大一部分都是在 Santa Monica 进行的。我对你在 Santa Monica 进行的其他工作很好奇，比如说，Santa Monica 校董会，你是怎么参与其中的工作，还成为它的领导者的？

**Breiman**: Well, let me back up a little bit on that one. My friends and I got to know this little village about 30 miles north of Puerto Vallarta called Mezcales. At the time, I was taking care of two or three kids even though I was a bachelor. But they were kids of friends of mine who had gone to Saudi Arabia to work and decided that was not a good place for kids to be.

So they sort of turned them over to me. And one of the kids was a young boy who was getting picked on by two older girls. I wanted to find another boy to even the score, but I couldn’t find another boy whose parents were willing to let go of him. Then somebody asked why not take up a couple of young Mexican boys from this village of Mezcales.

I went through an incredible hell with the bureaucracies—both Mexican and the United
States—but I managed to get these two kids up to live in my house with me. At that time it was in Topanga Canyon. They went to the local grammar school along with my American kids, and it was a great success.
