### SANTA MONICA, MEXICO, THE SCHOOL BOARD AND TEACHING KIDS MATHEMATICS
**Olshen**: That’s just fine. Now, somehow all of this or a lot of it seems to have taken place in Santa Monica. I’m curious about your other involvements in Santa Monica, for example, with the Santa Monica School Board, how you came to be not only on it, but also its leader.

**Olshen**: 很好。现在看来，这些工作全部或者说很大一部分都是在 Santa Monica 进行的。我对你在 Santa Monica 进行的其他工作很好奇，比如说，Santa Monica 校董会，你是怎么参与其中的工作，还成为它的领导者的？

**Breiman**: Well, let me back up a little bit on that one. My friends and I got to know this little village about 30 miles north of Puerto Vallarta called Mezcales. At the time, I was taking care of two or three kids even though I was a bachelor. But they were kids of friends of mine who had gone to Saudi Arabia to work and decided that was not a good place for kids to be.

So they sort of turned them over to me. And one of the kids was a young boy who was getting picked on by two older girls. I wanted to find another boy to even the score, but I couldn’t find another boy whose parents were willing to let go of him. Then somebody asked why not take up a couple of young Mexican boys from this village of Mezcales.

I went through an incredible hell with the bureaucracies—both Mexican and the United
States—but I managed to get these two kids up to live in my house with me. At that time it was in Topanga Canyon. They went to the local grammar school along with my American kids, and it was a great success.

### SENSUS
**Olshen**: Continuing in the spirit of large data sets, but very different from what we??ve discussed thus far, can you talk about your involvement in work on the Census adjustment?

**Olshen**: ????̸һ̸???ڼ?Ҫ???ִ????ݵ??趨??Ҫ??????֮ǰ???۵???????ͬ???????µ??й??ղ??ĵ????Ľ?չ???

**Breiman**: As I recall, in about 1987 or ??88, David Freedman said to me rather unexpectedly one day, ??Come on. Let??s go have lunch together.??

**Breiman**?????һ??䣬?ڴ?Լ1987??1988????ʱ???ɣ???һ??David FreedmanͻȻ????˵?????ߣ?????һ??ȥ???緹?ɡ???

As we were having lunch together, he said, ??How would you like to be on this committee that??s looking over plans for the 1990 Census???

??????һ?????緹??ʱ??????˵?????????????????ṩ??1990?????ղ??ƻ???ίԱ????ô???

And I said, ??No. I don??t want that. But I??ll tell you what I??ll do. I will get involved later on. But I don??t want to sit in on this committee.?? And then he got Ken Wachter to sit in on the committee.

??˵:????,?һ??????????????һ????????һ????ġ???֮??????????,?????Ҳ??????????ô????????ǵ?ʱ????Ken watcher ??????ίԱ?ᡣ

Ken did a wonderful job. Now, as the beginning of the 1990 Census rolled around in 1989, Dave called me up and said, more or less, ??Okay. I??m claiming my pound of flesh. I want you to get involved in the Census.?? So I said, ??Okay.??

Ken???ĺܺá???1989??ĩ??ʼ׼??1990?????ղ?ʱ??Dave???Ҵ??˸??绰,???????ٵĶ???˵:"?ð?.?ղ??????????Լ?????һ??,??ϣ?????????????ղ顣"?????Ҷ???˵:"??"??

And Dave and I began taking trips to various Cen-sus of offices as they became set up for the year 2000. He actually walked the streets with some of them [the census takers] to see how it was being done. And then it was over and that Census produced two different sets of figures.

????Dave???ҿ?ʼǰ??Ϊ??2000???ղ?????��?ĸ??ָ??????ղ??칫?ҡ???ʵ???????ĺ?һЩ???ڵ???Աһ??ȥ????��?Ӳ??ղ???????ʵʩ?ġ????ֹ۲?֮???ͽ?????,????????��?ֲ?ͬ???͵??ˡ?

One was just a straight enumerative count and the other was an effort to adjust the Census. The people that the Census missed were estimated to be about 2% of the population, or five million people. The way that the adjustment was made was basi-cally in terms of the capture?Crecapture idea. Shall I give a brief description of this? Okay.

һ??ֻ??ֱ?Ӹ??????????˶???һ????Ϊ?????ղ?????????��????.?ղ????????????��ƴ?ԼΪ???˿ڵ?2%,????˵????????.?????ķ?????Ҫ?ǻ???????-?????յ??뷨.???ܶԴ???һ?????̵Ľ????????.

It??s a simple idea. Suppose you want to know how many fish are in a lake. All right. So you go there and you fish and you fish and you fish, and each time you pull out a fish, you put a red mark on its back.

????һ???ܼ򵥵??뷨.????????֪??һ?????????ж??????㡣??,??????ȥ???ǿ?ʼһֱ????,????ÿ????????��????,?㶼???????ı?????һ????ɫ???ǡ?

You finally finish and you??ve counted, say, 10,000 fish. And you figure that you think you??ve got them all, but you??re not sure. So what you??re going to do is a come back a week later and you say, ??Okay. Now I am going to catch a 100 ???sh and see how many of them have got marks on the back.?? All right.

?????????ɲ?????һ??,˵,10000???㡣????????Ϊ???Ѿ?????ȫ????????,???㲢??ȷ??????????????��Ҫ??????????һ?ܺ??ص?????????,Ȼ????˵:"??.?????Ҵ???ץ100????Ȼ????һ??????֮???ж????ڱ????мǺš?"????һ??˳????

So you catch 100 fish and see how many have got marks on the back. Now, if originally you had captured all the fish in the lake, every one of those 100 would have a mark on its back. But you look at them, and only 98 have marks on the back. So you say, ??Oh, I didn??t get 2% of them the first time around.??

??????????ץ??һ?????㲢?ҿ?һ??????֮???ж??ٱ????б???.?????տ?ʼ??ץ???ĵ?ȷ?Ǻ?????????????,????????100??????ÿһ??????Ӧ?ö??б???.?????㿴??????,????ֻ??98???ڱ????мǺ?.??????˵:"Ŷ,?ҵ?һ?ε???ʱ????2%????û????��????"

There are more than 10,000 fish in the pond. I actually underestimated by 2%. But here is the big problem: Somebody notices that of the two fish that didn??t have marks on their backs, maybe one of them had a mark on its back, but it got rubbed off. So the undercount is no longer 2%. It??s gone down to 1%.

??????һ???г???10000???㡣????ʵ?ϵ͹???2%.????????????һ????????:??Щ?˷?????��???ڱ???û?б??ǵ??㡣???????????е?һ???ڱ???ԭ???б???,?????????��??ˡ??????ټ????Ĳ?????2%.???ʽ?????1%??

Maybe somebody else examines the other fish very carefully and notices that there may have been a mark on that fish??s back, too, in which case there??s no undercount. So notice then that you have to be able to match these fish to within 1 in 100 to get an accurate estimate of the undercount.

???ܱ???????ϸ????????һ???㲢?ҷ??ֿ????????㱳??Ҳ?и?????,?????????¾?û?????????ˡ?????ע????????????ͨ????Щ100????ץ??��1??????��????????��????һ??׼ȷ?Ĺ��ơ?

Now, to estimate the undercount in the 1990 Census??they did the Census first. Then they followed it by a mini-Census consisting, I think, of something like 50,000 households, I??m not sure of the exact number. Then they tried to match the people in the mini-Census to the original Census to see what kind of agreement they got.

????,Ϊ?˹��???1990???ղ?ʱ??????��,???????????ղ?,???ղ?֮????????????һ??С?????ĵ???,?Ҽǵú?????50000????ͥ??,?Ҽǲ?̫?????????????ˡ?֮?????ǳ???ȥͨ??ƥ??С???ղ??е??˺?ԭʼ???ղ?????��??һ??��?ε????ܴﵽ???̶߳ȵ?һ?¡?

And, for instance, if 2% of the people in the mini-Census were not found in the main Census, they would just assume that the main Census had under-counted by 2%. Also, by knowing the characteristics and location of the people in the mini-Census that weren??t found by the main Census, they would know the characteristics and location of the people the Census had missed.

?ٸ?????,??????С?͵????е?????2%??û??????Ҫ???ղ????ҵ?,????Ӧ????Ҫ?????ղ???????��Ϊ2%??ͬ??,??֪????û?????ղ????ҵ?????ЩС?͵????е??˵????Ժ????ڵص???????,????Ҳ????֪???ղ??????˵??˵????Ժ????ڵء?

Now, so the question was how accurate was this adjustment? This became a big court case because many states wanted an adjustment. They felt they had been undercounted, and Congressmen in the House of Representatives are apportioned on the basis of Census population.

???????ڵ??????????ֵ????ܴﵽ?ྫȷ?????????һ???ܴ??ķ??ɰ???,??Ϊ????Ժ?????ݵ???Աϯλ?ǻ????ղ????˿?��??????,???Ժܶ??ݶ?ϣ???ܹ??е???.???Ƕ??о??Լ??ݱ??????ˡ?

So adjustment could mean that a few congressional seats might swing from one state to another. Plus, a lot of the billions of dollars of federal money that goes out to cities and states are based on Census figures, so which set of figures to adopt -the original or the adjusted ??was a very political, big money question.

???Ե?????ζ??һС??????????ϯλ??????һ??ת??????һ?ݡ?????,��???????????ڼƵ????????к͸??ݵ?Ǯ?ǻ????ղ???????,????ȷ???????ķ???,???????????ڵĻ??ǵ???????,????һ?????κ;??õĴ????⡣

So I said, ??Okay, Dave. Here is what I??m going to do.?? The Census Bureau had done a large evaluation of the adjustment with thousands of pages of documentation. And I said, ??I??m going to look carefully at this evaluation and go through it page by page and see what it says about the accuracy of this adjustment procedure.??

??????˵:"??,Dave.????????Ҫ???????顣"?ղ????Ѿ?д????ǧҳ???ĵ?,???˴?��?йص????Ĺ��??��?,??????˵"?һ?һҳһҳ????ϸ?鿴??Щ?��۲??ҿ?????д?Ĺ??????????????̵?׼ȷ?ԡ?"

My experience in industry had been, if you get a data set, the first thing you do is you try to find out how good the data is you know, how much is missing, how much is in error and so on. That??s one thing you really learn by hard-knocks experience. And I began going through, and I was amazed.

???ڹ?ҵ?õ??ľ?????,????????һ?????ݼ?,??????Ҫ?????????ǳ???ȥȷ?????˽??????ݶ??????м?ֵ??,??????ȱʧ??,?????Ǵ????ĵȵ?.????һ???㾭???????۲???ѧ???????顣Ȼ???ҿ?ʼ??????,????????ʮ?־??ȡ?

More and more of this supposed adjustment was clearly due to errors than anything else. Realize this: Here on one hand you??ve got, say, 100 slips of paper about 100 Americans from the mini-Census; on the other hand, you??ve got 100 slips of paper from the main Census, and the question is how many of them can you match?

??????????????,???ö???????Ӧ?еĵ??????????????ڴ????????µġ?????Ҫ??ʶ??:?????ջ???һ????,??˵???Ǵ?С?͵????еõ??Ĺ???100???��??˵?100??????;??????һ????,???????????ղ??е?100??????,????????????֮?еĶ??????ܶ?Ӧ???

Well, many times people give different, say, middle names to the Census. They give different ages, different sexes. You can??t match people that well. You need 99% accuracy in matching to get 50% accu-racy in a 2% undercount. So the whole problem is that Americans, because of their mobility and immigrant status and so on, cannot be matched to within 99%.

?ð?,?ܶ?ʱ?????????ղ?ʱ?????ǲ?ͬ???????????ṩ?˲?ͬ??????,?Ա?,??û?취?????Ƕ?Ӧ????ô?á?????Ҫ99%??׼ȷ?Բ?????2%??????��??????????50%?ľ?ȷ?ȡ??????��??˵??ƶ???,????????????λ?ȵ????ص?Ӱ??,?????????????????��??˲??????????ܹ?ƥ????Ӧ?ﵽ99%??

And so if you look at it and evaluate, the errors pile up. As you know, I finally wrote a big paper in Statistical Science (Breiman, 1994), summarizing all the research I had done based on Census docu-ments, and I concluded that easily over 80% of the estimated Census adjustment was due to bad data, mainly errors in matching.

Now, here is the thing that floors me, Richard. The Census Bureau admits in its own internal publications that at least 57% of its proposed 1990 adjustment was due to bad data. You??d think that after getting stung so badly by the data and the evaluation of the adjustment in 1990, they wouldn??t try to do it again. Because if something fails, you just don??t repeat it. Well, what they??re doing instead in 2000 is most interesting. They??re going to do it again, but not evaluate it!

###ADVICE
**Olshen**: Leo, you have a record of wide ranging interest in and contributions to statistics and statistical computing and probability and pedagogy. What advice would you give to a young person today who wants to continue in your traditions? What should he or she study and why?

**Olshen**:Leo,????ͳ??ѧ,ͳ?Ƶ??Դ??���???ʺͽ?ѧ??Щ?????й㷺????Ȥ?͹??ף?????????Щ?????????̳????Ĵ?ͳ??ҵ??????????ʲô???????????Ӧ??ѧЩʲô?Լ?Ϊʲô?

**Breiman**: Well Richard, I??m torn in a way because what I might even tell them is, ??Don??t go into statistics.?? My feeling is, to some extent, that academic statistics may have lost its way. When I came, after consulting, back to the Berke-ley Department, I felt like I was almost enteringAlice in Wonderland. That is, I knew what was going on out in industry and government in terms of uses of statistics, but what was going on in academic research seemed light years away. It was proceeding as though it were some branch of abstract mathematics. One of our senior faculty members said a while back, ??We have to keep alive the spirit of Wald.?? But before the good old days of Wald and the divorce of statistics from data, there were the good old days of Fisher, who believed that statistics existed for the purposes of prediction and explanation and working with data.

**Breiman**:?ð?Richard,??ĳ?̶ֳ???,?Ҹо??Һ?????????һ??,??Ϊ?ҿ??ܻ?????????:"??Ҫȥѧͳ??."?Ҹо???һ???̶???,ͳ?Ƶ?ѧ???????????Ѿ???ʧ??.????????ѯ??,?ص???Berkeley Department֮??��????????ʱ??,?Ҹо??Һ?????ͬ????˿?????ɾ?һ??.?Ǹо?????,??֪?��?ͳ??Ӧ?õĽǶȹ?ҵ???????????ڷ???Щʲô,????ѧ???о????ڽ??е??ƺ????????ޱ?ңԶ.????ֻ?ǳ?????ѧ??ĳһ??֧һ????ǰ??????????һѧ?Ƶ?һλ??ǰ??˵:"??????Ҫ????Wald?ľ???????."??????Wald??ʱ???Լ?ͳ?ƴ??????з?????��֮ǰ,????????ͳ?ƵĴ?????Ϊ??Ԥ???ͽ????Լ????????ݵ?Fisher?Ķ?ʢʱ?ڡ?

Before you came this morning, I pulled out Webster??s dictionary and looked for the definition of statistics, and here is how it goes: ??Statistics, facts or data of the numerical kind assembled, classified, and tabulated so as to present significant information about a given subject.?? When used with a singular verb, it is, quote, ??The science of the assembling, classifying, tabulating, and analyzing such facts or data.??
 
?????????糿��֮ǰ,?ҷ???��??Webster?ʵ䲢???ҵ???ͳ?ƵĶ???,??????ô˵??:"ͳ??,?????????ռ???,??????,??????Ϊ??չ?ָ????????ض???Ϣ????ʵ???????ݡ?"????ʹ?õ??ǵ?һ?Ķ???ʱ,??д????"һ???ռ?,????,???���?ҷ?????ʵ?????ݵĿ?ѧ??"

Now, little of that is going on in the academic world of statistics. For instance, I was looking at The Annals of Statistics and I estimate that maybe 1 paper in 20 had any data in it or applied the methods there to any kind of data. The ratio is not much higher in the Journal of the American Statistical Association. So my view of what??s fascinating in the subject of statistics and the common academic view are pretty far apart.

????,?Ǹ????????????ݼ?????û????????ͳ?Ƶ?ѧ???��???ٸ?????,?????ڿ?ͳ?Ʊ???ʷ,?ҹ��ƴ?Լ??ʮҳ??ʷ????һҳ?????ݻ???Ӧ???˶????????ݴ????İ취.???????ʲ??????��?ͳ??Э??????־???ĸߺܶࡣ?????ҵĹ۵???ͳ??????ѧ?????˵ĵط???ͨ????ѧ???۵??Ѿ??ֵ??????ˡ?

In the past five or six years, I??ve become close to the people in the machine learning and neural nets areas because they are doing important applied work on big, tough prediction problems. They??re data oriented and what they are doing corresponds exactly to Webster??s definition of statistics, but almost none of them are statisticians by training.

So I think if I were advising a young person today, I would have some reservations about advising him or her to go into statistics, but probably, in the end, I would say, ??Take statistics, but remember that the great adventure of statistics is in gathering and using data to solve interesting and important real world problems.??

###The artist
**Olshen**:Thank you. The room in which we are having this conversation, even the house itself, is full of reminders of the breadth of your interests, not least your life as an artist. What about that side of Leo Breiman?

**Olshen**:лл.?????ڽ??жԻ???????????,????????????,ȫ?????ֵظ???????????Ȥ???÷?Χ֮??,??????????Ϊ?????ҵ?????ⷽ????????ʲô???ӵ??

**Breiman**: Well, during my consultant time in Los Angeles, I could actually make enough money in a fairly small number of hours that I had a fair amount of leisure time. And I remembered that when I first came up to Cal, my first roommate, of whom I was very fond, was an art major. He encouraged me to sculpt and I made some things out of clay. I didn??t think much of them.

**Breiman**:?ð?.????????ɼ���?????Ա??ʱ??,????ʵ?Ͽ??????൱?̵ļ???Сʱ??׬???㹻??Ǯ???????д??ѵĿ???ʱ?䡣?????Ҽǵ????????ĵ?һ??????Cal,????????????,?Һ?ϲ????.????????ȥ???̶?????Ҳ??????һЩ????,?ҵ?ʱ??û????̫?ࡣ

Then when I had this leisure time in Los Ange-les much later on, I took a sculpting class at UCLA Extension. There was a wonderful teacher who encouraged us to do all sorts of wild things. I also met this fellow, who came and talked to us once, who had a foundry for bronze casting in Venice??Alf Peterson. Alf was a marvelous guy And he said, ??If you want to practice, come down to the foundry. I??ll show you how to do things.??

I made a figure out of clay and wax and chicken screen. That was my first angel over there (indicating) in the corner. And I took it down to Alf??s place and he said, ??Okay. I??m going to show you how to cast bronze.??

????ճ?��?��?ͣ?????????һ??????ǣ????Ǹ????䣬?????ҵĵ?һ??????ʹ????ָ?????ܣ???????????????ȥ????Alf?????쳧????˵?????ã??ҽ?????չʾ??????ͭ????

He showed me how to make molds of the angel, how to make the negatives, how to put it in the ovens, how to pour the bronze and so on. I was intrigued and absorbed. I thought that it was terrific And so I??ve kept going ever since then and have loved it.

Lately, though, I??ve begun working in stone, which is very interesting. So you??ll see some stone heads also drifting around. And that??s slow work. You??ve got to keep tinkling, tinkling with the hammer and chisel.
